## Usage Instructions for update_docs.sh

[Source](https://tgsmith61591.github.io/2018-12-23-automate-gh-builds/) for script

1. Ensure that pymasq is installed in your environment

1. Make sure that `update_docs.sh` has execute permissions  

    ```sh
    chmod +x update_docs.sh 
    ```  
  
1. Ensure that the snapshot-\<version\> branch you want to generate documentation for exists
(You do not have to currently be on that branch)  
    Example:

    ```bash
    (pymasq) workstation:docs user$ git branch
      user-0.0-1
    * user-0.0-2
      gh-pages
      master
      snapshot-0.0
      snapshot-test
    ```

1. Change to the `pymasq/docs/` directory:  
    Example:

    ```sh
    cd ./docs/
    ```

1. Run the script, passing the snapshot version number with the "-v=\<VERSION #\>" or "--version=\<VERSION #\>" flag.
(The script will not run if the snapshot version does not exist or if there is no argument passed). If hosting the
documentation on gh-pages is not required, you can pass the optional flag "-o" or "--offline"
which will generate the html documentation in `pymasq/docs/build/`.  
    Example:

    ```sh
    ./update_docs.sh -v=0.6.3-SNAPSHOT
    ```
